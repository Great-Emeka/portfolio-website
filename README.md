# Intro:
Hi, My name is Emeka GREAT Chimezie and I am a frontend Engineer. This repository is for my personal portfolio website. To check it out, visit: [greatemeka.netlify.app]

# Technologies Used:
This portfolio website is built with the core technologies of the web viz: HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript, I kept it simple, responsive, accessible, no framework was used and I ensured semantic markup throughout.

I also made It a Progressive Web Application(PWA), meaning it is fast, and reliable, works offline and more importantlly, it's installable on all devics.
